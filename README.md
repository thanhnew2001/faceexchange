This can be improved for more efficiency:

To enhance the efficiency of your face-swapping code, consider implementing these improvements:

**Optimize Landmark Detection:** Repeatedly detecting landmarks for static images (img and img2 are constant) within a loop can be avoided. Detect once and reuse the data.
**Cache Landmark Points and Triangulation: **Store the results of costly operations like Delaunay triangulation for static images to avoid recomputing in each frame. This step is crucial if the original image does not change over time.
**Use Efficient Array Operations:** The function extract_index_nparray can be optimized to use more efficient numpy operations, reducing the overhead of Python loops.
**Code Redundancy and Reusability:** Modularize repeated blocks of code into functions to avoid redundancy and improve maintainability.
**Parallel Processing: **If possible, use parallel processing techniques to handle independent tasks concurrently, leveraging Pythonâ€™s multiprocessing capabilities.
**Preprocessing:** Consider preprocessing aspects like converting images to grayscale or resizing to reduce computational requirements if real-time performance is necessary.

**For video processing**
It could be even more sufficient if the source image is static and dropped to small enough with only face and color. 

Face detect for video will be more optimized if we can limit the region containing face.
